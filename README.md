# nextSongPuck
Use your puck.js to skip to the next song on your smartphone via a simple button.

This is usefull while driving in your car or skiing or snowboarding with gloves, since you don't need to fiddle around on the touch-display of your smartphone. Instead you use a nice and simple tactile button to jump to the next song.

Be sure to update your puck to the newest firmware version. You can find instructions how to update the firmware here: https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js#firmware-updates
